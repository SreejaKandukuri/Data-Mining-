Titanic Analysis: The primary goal of this project is to comprehend The Titanic dataset and analyze it in order to develop a model that reliably predicts the number of survivors in order to assist insurance companies in calculating the maximum mortality rate in the event of any disasters. 

MLR, PCA, KNN: Insurance firms are constantly striving to assess insurance policy prices as accurately as possible. To do so, they rely on a thorough grasp of the different elements that determine the cost of coverage. In this analysis, we will go through the complex web of insurance pricing, shedding light on the fundamental criteria that affect the cost of insurance plans.

Text Mining: The goal of this project is to obtain a better comprehension of the text's contents and to identify the significant themes, words, or concepts that appear throughout it. We will use tools and methodologies to preprocess the data, analyze word frequency, and finally depict our findings using a word cloudâ€”a visual representation of the most frequently occurring terms in the text.

KNN: The KNN models' success in identifying different income levels in the dataset sheds light on their potential real-world use. The evaluation measures show that the models, especially those with a reduced k value of 5, have reasonable accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. However, various considerations must be addressed while determining its applicability in real-world circumstances. The models attain accuracy values more than 80%, implying that they can efficiently distinguish between low- and high-income persons using the given features. 

Regression: A car manufacturer known for making large automobiles is struggling with sales and has asked for your help in designing an energy efficient car. The analysis of various linear regression models and stepwise selection sheds light on the factors impacting the fuel economy (MPG) of the cars in the dataset. By focusing on crucial characteristics like "Weight" and "Horsepower," the company can strategically improve its products

SVM: We want to deliver actionable insights to the magazine company by meticulously purifying data, modeling with logistic regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and doing a comparative analysis of model performances. Finally, given its higher performance, the SVM RBF model is recommended for forecasting subscription behavior in this context. Adjusting the collection of variables to omit less important ones can result in a more efficient and understandable model. Based on the findings of the logistic regression and SVM (RBF kernel) models, it is recommended that the company pay close attention to the variables "Recency" and "AmountSpentOnFood." These variables showed consistent relevance across both models and were shown to be useful in predicting consumer response behavior.
