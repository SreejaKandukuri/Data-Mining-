Titanic Analysis: The primary goal of this project is to comprehend The Titanic dataset and analyze it in order to develop a model that reliably predicts the number of survivors in order to assist insurance companies in calculating the maximum mortality rate in the event of any disasters. 

MLR, PCA, KNN: Insurance firms are constantly striving to assess insurance policy prices as accurately as possible. To do so, they rely on a thorough grasp of the different elements that determine the cost of coverage. In this analysis, we will go through the complex web of insurance pricing, shedding light on the fundamental criteria that affect the cost of insurance plans.

Text Mining: The goal of this project is to obtain a better comprehension of the text's contents and to identify the significant themes, words, or concepts that appear throughout it. We will use tools and methodologies to preprocess the data, analyze word frequency, and finally depict our findings using a word cloudâ€”a visual representation of the most frequently occurring terms in the text.

KNN: The KNN models' success in identifying different income levels in the dataset sheds light on their potential real-world use. The evaluation measures show that the models, especially those with a reduced k value of 5, have reasonable accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. However, various considerations must be addressed while determining its applicability in real-world circumstances. The models attain accuracy values more than 80%, implying that they can efficiently distinguish between low- and high-income persons using the given features.
